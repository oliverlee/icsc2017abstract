%% The LABEL extensions for proofing. J. Kaipio, 4.4.1995
%% CAPTIONS FOR TABLES AND FIGURES
%%
%%  There's a new logical variable \tablecap, which is
%%  set \true by saying \tablecaptrue and \false by
%%  \tablecapfalse. The variable is expanded by saying
%%  \iftablecap. Then there are two separate \caption
%%  macros: \tabcaption and \figcaption, the definition
%%  of which are obvious. The \iftablecap is performed in
%%  \@makecaption, which now contains two different
%%  captioning styles.
%%                               J. Kaipio 3.10.1990.
